# This Dockerfile is optional and was generated using:
#   $ gcloud preview app gen-config .
# The default base image is a Debian-based container with Node.js installed.
# The image will execute "npm start" to run the application. You can customize
# this Dockerfile to modify your application's runtime environment, or you can
# use a different base image entirely.
